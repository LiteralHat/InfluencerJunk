            <br>
            <p>So this is actually a parody site, if it's not already painfully obvious. This is my 'playground' site for testing new concepts and ideas, all the products displayed are as fake as an influencer's talent.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Feel free to add items to your cart, go through the checkout process, and even enter your real info if
                you're feeling reckless. But don't sue me because you didn't receive your sweatshop product that you
                paid $0 for.</p>
                <br>
            <p>All items, even those that are based on real products, are entirely fictional. Those who decide to make
                legitimate versions of such parody items on this website have completely missed the point, and are
                advised to take their education more seriously.</p>
                <br>
                <p>- With love from <a href='https://literalhat.com/'>LiteralHat</a>.</p>
