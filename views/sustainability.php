        <h1 class="large">Sustainability</h1>
        <p>You see, at InfluencerJunk.com, we're deeply passionate about the planet, and like, human welfare and stuff.
            So we decided that we will be the bigger <span class="strikethrough">company</span> person and actually make
            an effort unlike all the <span class="italics">OTHERS</span> (eyeroll). What better way to express our
            concern than to create a section of our website PURELY dedicated to our love for MOTHER NATURE?</p>

        <h2>Our Products</h2>

        <p>All our products are shipped in <span class="italics bold">200%</span> recycled cardboard! That's a <span
                class='italics bold'>200% (TWO HUNDRED PERCENT!!!)</span> increase from the typical 100% post-consumer
            recycled cardboard on the market.*</p>

        <p>Our vinyls are packaged in IANAL速 certified, FART速 approved, CBT速 guarantee, and LWYMMDLWYMMDLWYJMMDLWYJMMD速
            recognised plastic. The sleeves are produced with post-consumer post-household household-grade second-hand
            up-cycled asbestos, and we encourage you to reuse them because, like, you're responsible and you want to
            save the planet too, right?
        </p>

        <p class="tiny">
            *Disclaimer: This does not include any plastic packaging that might be used by our courier. It is 200% out
            of our control.
        </p>

            InfluencerJunk.com factory employees
        </p>

        <p>At InfluencerJunk.com's company office, we only hire employees who agree to use paper straws during office
            hours. Individuals who fail to comply are slapped violently on the wrist and forced to sit in the time out
            corner.</p>
